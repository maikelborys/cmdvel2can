- [ ] VESC message builder with protocol handling
- [ ] Basic safety system
- [ ] Unit tests for each component

### Phase 3: Enhanced Safety Integration
- [ ] Velocity monitor implementation
- [ ] Incremental controller with acceleration curves
- [ ] Pre-launch validation system
- [ ] Motor protection mechanisms
- [ ] Integration testing

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Hardware-in-the-loop testing
- [ ] Safety system validation
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation completion

## Development Workflow

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone and setup workspace
cd /home/robot/robot_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash

# Verify package structure
ls -la src/cmdvel_to_can_bridge_ros2/
```

### 2. Build Process
```bash
# Build only this package
colcon build --packages-select cmdvel_to_can_bridge_ros2

# Build with debug symbols for development
colcon build --packages-select cmdvel_to_can_bridge_ros2 --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

# Clean build when needed
rm -rf build/cmdvel_to_can_bridge_ros2 install/cmdvel_to_can_bridge_ros2
colcon build --packages-select cmdvel_to_can_bridge_ros2
```

### 3. Testing Workflow
```bash
# Unit tests (when implemented)
colcon test --packages-select cmdvel_to_can_bridge_ros2
colcon test-result --verbose

# Integration testing with mock hardware
ros2 launch cmdvel_to_can_bridge_ros2 debug.launch.py

# Hardware testing (wheels off ground!)
ros2 launch cmdvel_to_can_bridge_ros2 cmdvel_to_can_bridge.launch.py
```

### 4. Code Implementation Guidelines

#### Class Implementation Order
1. **CANInterface**: Start with basic SocketCAN communication
2. **VelocityConverter**: Implement differential drive kinematics
3. **CANMessageBuilder**: Add VESC protocol support
4. **SafetySystem**: Basic watchdog and limits
5. **VelocityMonitor**: cmd_vel_real subscription and validation
6. **IncrementalController**: Smooth velocity transitions
7. **CmdVelToCANNode**: Main node integration

#### Safety-First Development
- Always implement safety checks before functionality
- Test emergency stop mechanisms first
- Validate all parameters before use
- Log all safety events for debugging

### 5. Configuration Management

#### Parameter Categories
- **Robot Physical**: Wheel dimensions, VESC IDs
- **Safety Limits**: Velocity bounds, acceleration limits
- **Monitoring**: Feedback timeouts, frequency requirements
- **Control**: Incremental adjustment parameters

#### Configuration Testing
```bash
# Validate parameter files
ros2 param load /cmdvel_to_can_bridge config/params.yaml --dry-run

# Test with different robot configurations
ros2 launch cmdvel_to_can_bridge_ros2 cmdvel_to_can_bridge.launch.py \
  robot_config:=config/robot_config.yaml
```

## Safety Development Protocol

### Pre-Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Safety requirements documented
- [ ] Emergency stop mechanism designed
- [ ] Velocity limits validated against hardware specs
- [ ] Failure modes identified and handled

### Implementation Priorities
1. **Emergency Stop**: Immediate halt capability
2. **Velocity Validation**: Input bounds checking
3. **Watchdog Timer**: Communication health monitoring
4. **Incremental Control**: Smooth transitions only
5. **Motor Protection**: Current and temperature monitoring

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Emergency stop response time < 100ms
- [ ] Velocity validation prevents out-of-bounds commands
- [ ] Watchdog triggers within configured timeout
- [ ] Incremental controller prevents abrupt changes
- [ ] System fails safe in all error conditions
